[There's an article which has been going around Facebook lately.][1]  I finally
got around to reading it.  It's titled "You just broke your child.
Congratulations."  Even though I should be going to bed, I had to share it with
you.

Here's an excerpt:

> Dads. Stop breaking your children. Please.
>
> I feel a need to write this post after what I witnessed at Costco yesterday.
> Forgive me for another post written in desperation and anger. Please read all
> the way to the end. I know it's long, but this is something that *needs* to
> be said. It's something that *needs* to be heard. It's something that *needs*
> to be shared.
>
> As Noah and I stood in line to make a return, I watched as a little boy (he
> couldn't have been older than six) looked up at his dad and asked very
> timidly if they could buy some ice cream when they were done. The father
> glared him down, and through clenched teeth, growled at the boy to "leave him
> alone and be quiet." The boy quickly cowered to the wall where he stood
> motionless and hurt for some time.
>
> The line slowly progressed and the child eventually shuffled back to his
> father as he quietly hummed a childish tune, seemingly having forgotten the
> anger his father had just shown. The father again turned and scolded the boy
> for making too much noise. The boy again shrunk back and cowered against the
> wall, wilted.
>
> I was agitated. I was confused. How could this man not see what I see? How
> could this man not see what a beautiful spirit stood in his shadow? How could
> this man be so quick to stub out all happiness in his own boy? How could this
> man not cherish the only time he'll ever have to be *everything* to this boy?
> To be the person that matters *most* to this boy?

Read the article.  It's potentially life-changing, whether you're a dad now, or
might be someday in the future.  I feel like it's changed my life, and I'm a
long ways off from being a dad myself.  Hopefully when that day comes, I can be
the kind of dad he talks about in that post.

PS:  Hopefully I remember (and have the motivation) to post on here more often.
I have a lot harder time posting about life than about technology.....  ;-)
Stay tuned!
